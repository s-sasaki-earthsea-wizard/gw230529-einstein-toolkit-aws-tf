# A read-only role for watching a run, assumable without MFA.
#
# WHY IT EXISTS
#
# Everything that blocked an unattended watcher during the 2026-08-26 recovery
# test was read-only: reading the CURRENT marker, listing a checkpoint slot,
# fetching the bootstrap log while the run was in flight, `make throughput`,
# `make heartbeat`, and DescribeInstances to tell "finished" from "stuck".
# None of it needs gw230529-terraform-operator, and every one of those calls
# had to be relayed to a human holding an MFA device.
#
# WHY NOT credential_process WITH A STORED TOTP SEED
#
# That would remove the six digit prompt from the operator profile, and it
# would also put both factors on the same disk under the same uid: the access
# key in ~/.aws/credentials and the seed beside it. AWS would still evaluate
# aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent as true, so the trust condition in
# stacks/bootstrap/operator_role.tf would go on being satisfied while the
# property it is there to buy was gone for anything that can read the home
# directory.
#
# It is also the wrong shape for the problem. The friction is in *reading*,
# and reading is exactly the part that does not need a second factor.
#
# WHY HERE AND NOT IN stacks/bootstrap
#
# The operator role lives in bootstrap to avoid the circularity of a role
# defined in a stack that the role itself applies. Nothing is ever applied
# with this role, so no such circularity exists. Foundation already owns the
# data bucket the policy scopes to, and bootstrap is deliberately minimal
# because its state is local.
#
# The cost of that choice: `terraform destroy` here removes the role, and the
# observer profile then fails with AccessDenied rather than announcing itself.

  # The state bucket name lives in backend.hcl, which Terraform does not
  # expose to the configuration, so pinning it exactly means repeating it as
  # a variable. Null falls back to the pattern stacks/bootstrap creates it
  # under -- a wildcard that would matter only if a second bucket were ever
  # named gw230529-tfstate-something.

# Who may assume the role. Note what is NOT here: the
# aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent condition that stacks/bootstrap puts on the
# operator role.
#
# That absence is the whole point, and it is a conscious trade rather than an
# omission. Before it, an access key leaked on its own bought nothing at all.
# After it, the same key buys read access to the data bucket, to the
# foundation and compute state, and to some describes. What it does not buy is
# any ability to change, create or destroy anything, or to spend money.
#
# The bucket holds simulation output and checkpoints, not secrets -- though
# the bootstrap log does carry the account id, which is why this repository
# keeps that id out of tracked files in the first place.
#
# A dedicated observer IAM user with its own key would separate the material
# further. It would also add a second long-term key, which is the direction
# this project has spent the last week moving away from.
