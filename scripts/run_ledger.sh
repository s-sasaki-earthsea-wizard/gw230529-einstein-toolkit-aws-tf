# Reconstruct what actually happened to a run: every node that served it, when
# each started and stopped, why it stopped, and how much of the elapsed wall
# clock was spent evolving rather than waiting.
#
# WHAT THIS IS FOR
#
# Spot capacity is bought at roughly a third of on-demand, and paid for in
# interruptions. Deciding whether that trade is worth taking again needs the
# price measured, not assumed, and the price is delay: the difference between
# how long the run took and how long it computed.
#
# Two ratios, and conflating them hides where the time went:
#
#   duty cycle       node uptime / wall clock span
#                    How much of the elapsed time a machine existed at all.
#                    What interruptions cost, plus however long it took
#                    somebody to notice and relaunch.
#
#   compute fraction evolution time / node uptime
#                    How much of a live node was evolving rather than
#                    booting, pulling the image, restoring 174 GB from S3 and
#                    reading a checkpoint. Roughly 13 minutes per start,
#                    measured 2026-08-27, so this is the term that punishes
#                    frequent short-lived nodes even when capacity is easy.
#
#   effective        evolution time / wall clock span -- the product of the
#                    two, and the number to compare against a run that was
#                    never interrupted.
#
# WHERE THE EVIDENCE COMES FROM
#
# logs/<run_name>/ holds one bootstrap log per instance (they carry the
# instance id since 2026-08-27; before that each node overwrote the last) and
# one ended-<instance>.json per instance that stopped in a way it could report.
#
#   started    first stamped line of the bootstrap log
#   evolution  first to last CarpetIOBasic info line in that log
#   ended      the marker object, written by the spot watcher on an
#              interruption notice and by section 8 on a clean exit
#
# A node with a bootstrap log and no marker is one of two things, told apart
# by how fresh its last line is: "running" if it is still syncing, and
# otherwise "vanished" -- it went away without even the two minute notice, a
# hardware fault or a termination nobody announced. For both, the end is taken
# as the last line that reached S3, which understates uptime by up to one sync
# interval.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/run_ledger.sh [options] [s3://bucket/logs/<run_name>/]
#
#   With no argument the current run is read from the compute stack.
#
# Options:
#   --keep DIR   keep the downloaded logs in DIR instead of a temp directory
#
# Examples:
#   scripts/run_ledger.sh
#   AWS_PROFILE=gw230529-observer scripts/run_ledger.sh
#   scripts/run_ledger.sh s3://gw230529-data-earthsea/logs/prod-dx19p2-1750m/
