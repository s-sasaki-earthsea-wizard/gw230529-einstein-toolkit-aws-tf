# Fetch the Einstein Toolkit gallery artefacts this project runs on.
#
# Four files, 1.6 MB: the BH-NS parameter file and the FUKA/Kadath initial
# data it imports. They are upstream gallery material, so this repository
# records where they come from and what they should hash to, and nothing else.
# Downloads land in a gitignored directory and are never committed, never
# baked into the container image, and never pushed to ECR -- a mis-set
# repository visibility would otherwise turn an inconvenience into a
# redistribution problem.
#
# Why fetch here rather than reach into the simulation repository. The old
# default pointed INPUTS_DIR at ../gw230529-einstein-toolkit/upstream, which
# meant a fresh clone of this repository could not do a production run at all
# unless the sibling happened to be checked out beside it, and nothing
# declared that dependency. Fetching from the gallery makes this repository
# stand on its own -- and gives a better starting point besides: the sibling's
# copy of the .info file has a host-specific absolute EOS path edited into it,
# while upstream still carries the /path/to/ placeholder the node's boot-time
# rewrite is written against.
#
# Checksums are pinned. Two repositories fetching the same artefacts
# independently can drift, and upstream can change under us without saying so.
