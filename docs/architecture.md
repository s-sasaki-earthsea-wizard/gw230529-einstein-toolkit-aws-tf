# Architecture

Cloud execution environment for the GW230529 BH-NS merger simulation
(Phases 4–6 of the [simulation
repository](https://github.com/s-sasaki-earthsea-wizard/gw230529-einstein-toolkit)).

Constraints that shaped every decision:

- **300 USD total budget.** Anything that bills by the hour while idle is out.
- **Single spot node.** No multi-node, no EFA. The reference run is 480 ranks
  of pure MPI across 12 nodes, about 14,600 core-hours to the target evolution
  time; 192 physical cores on one machine is the closest single-node
  equivalent, at 38–76 hours. Whether the working set fits in one node is
  decided by Phase 5, not assumed here.
- **S3 is the system of record.** EBS is scratch. A spot interruption must
  never lose more than one sync interval of work.
- **No inbound ports.** Operations go through SSM Session Manager.

### Why a public subnet

The node needs outbound access for the SSM agent and inbound access for
nothing. Both private-subnet designs cost real money against a 300 USD cap:

| Option | Idle cost | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Public subnet + internet gateway + S3 gateway endpoint | **0 USD/month** | adopted |
| Private subnet + NAT gateway | ~33 USD/month plus data processing | rejected |
| Private subnet + 5 interface endpoints | ~36 USD/month | rejected |

A public subnet with an empty ingress rule set has the same effective exposure
as a private one: no port is reachable. The S3 gateway endpoint is free and
keeps sync traffic off the internet gateway entirely, which also removes any
path to an accidental egress charge.

## Region and instance selection

The region is effectively permanent — ECR images and S3 objects are
region-bound, so moving means re-pushing 4.06 GB and re-uploading every result.
`make region-scout` produces the three numbers the decision rests on.

Measured 2026-08-19, target capacity 192 vCPU, single availability zone,
scored across c7a/m7a/c7i .48xlarge. The candidate list has changed since —
see "Choosing the instance type" below — but the regional conclusion has not,
because every candidate is a 192 vCPU AMD Genoa part drawn from the same pool:

| Region | Zones scoring 9 | Cheapest c7a.48xlarge | Spot vCPU quota |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| us-west-2 | 3 of 4 | 2.970 USD/h (us-west-2d) | 256 |
| us-east-1 | 4 of 6 | 2.996 USD/h (us-east-1a) | 256 |
| us-east-2 | 2 of 3, one at 6 | 2.572 USD/h (us-east-2a) | **5** |

**us-east-2 is out**: cheapest by ~15%, but the spot vCPU quota is 5, and a
quota increase takes hours to days to approve. Over a 76 hour run the saving
is about 30 USD — real money against a 300 USD cap, but not worth putting the
schedule behind a support ticket, and us-east-2 also scores 9 in only two of
its three zones.

**us-west-2 over us-east-1.** Capacity is not the differentiator — both score
9 with the quota already raised. The averages across their viable zones are
3.11 USD/h for us-west-2 against 3.32 for us-east-1, roughly 6 USD over a 30
hour run: also not the differentiator. What decides it is that us-west-2's
fallback zones stay near its cheapest (3.05 and 3.32 against 2.97), whereas
us-east-1's jump to 3.49 and 3.52. Being pushed off the preferred zone costs
less. us-east-1 also concentrates a disproportionate share of AWS-wide
capacity events; one fewer scoring zone is a smaller risk than that.

Preferred zone **us-west-2d** (`usw2-az4`), then `us-west-2a`, then
`us-west-2c`. Zone names are shuffled per account — the IDs are what stay
put, and `make region-scout` prints the mapping.

Those three names go into the foundation stack's `availability_zones`, and
that list is what the compute stack can choose from: it looks its subnet up by
zone name, so a zone with no subnet is a plan-time error rather than a
fallback. The alternative — taking the first N zones the region reports — sorts
by name, which in us-west-2 yields a, b and c: it omits the cheapest scored
zone and includes `us-west-2b` (`usw2-az1`), which scored nothing at all.
Subnets are free, so the fallback costs nothing but capacity; it is a default,
not a placement decision.

## Choosing the instance type

The reference run's own numbers, read out of its published Carpet log and
SLURM epilogue rather than from a summary (measured 2026-08-20 in the
simulation repository):

| Quantity | Reference run |
| --- | --- |
| Parallelism | 480 ranks, 12 nodes × 40 cores |
| Wall clock | 46.4 h to t = 3041 M; about 30.5 h to t = 2000 M |
| Target evolution | ~14,600 core-hours to t = 2000 M |
| Memory | 438.5 GB, 12 node total, as reported by SLURM |
| Speed | 3.30 sec/iter at dt = 0.06 M |
| Merger | t ≈ 713 M (ψ4 amplitude peaks at 1213 M, less the r = 500 M light travel) |

Two of these replace figures this document previously carried: the run is 480
ranks and not 256, and the memory is 438.5 GB and not 140 GB. The origin of
the 140 GB number could not be established, and it is no longer used anywhere.

### Memory decides it, not price

438.5 GB is a 12-node total at 480 ranks. A 192 rank run duplicates fewer
ghost zones and so needs less, but the reduction is weak: each rank's chunk
grows 2.5× in volume and only 1.36× in linear size, and ghost overhead follows
the linear size. Read the SLURM figure the most generous way available — as
decimal GB, hence 408 GiB — and it still sits above c7a.48xlarge's 384 GiB
before any reduction is applied.

The production instance type is therefore **not settled**. Phase 5 measuring
the np=192 working set is a go/no-go gate, not a formality: if it does not fit
one node, multi-node MPI stops being an optional later exercise and becomes a
requirement.

| Type | Physical cores | Memory | Channels | Spot USD/h | USD per physical core-hour |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| c7a.48xlarge | 192 Genoa @ 3.7 GHz | 384 GiB | 12 × DDR5 | 2.978 | **0.0155** |
| m7a.48xlarge | 192 Genoa @ 3.7 GHz | 768 GiB | 12 × DDR5 | 3.747 | 0.0195 |
| r7a.48xlarge | 192 Genoa @ 3.7 GHz | 1536 GiB | 12 × DDR5 | 4.220 | 0.0220 |
| c7i.48xlarge | 96 SPR @ 3.2 GHz + HT | 384 GiB | 8 × DDR5 | 3.072 | 0.0320 |
| c7a.24xlarge | 96 Genoa @ 3.7 GHz | 192 GiB | 12 × DDR5 | 1.950 | 0.0203 |

us-west-2d spot prices, measured 2026-08-20.

**c7a.48xlarge is the production type**, decided by measurement on
2026-08-20 rather than by the projection this section originally carried. A
full resolution run at np=192 and 8 refinement levels reported 125.273 GByte
from Carpet and 136 GiB across the whole node — 35% of c7a's 384 GiB.

The earlier reasoning read the reference run's 438.5 GB as a floor for what
192 ranks would need. It is not: that is a scheduler's high water mark over
480 ranks spread across 12 nodes, and a decomposition that fine duplicates
far more ghost zones. Carpet reports the effect directly — grid function
points run to +95% over owned at np=192 against +68% at np=32.

m7a.48xlarge (768 GiB) stays the fallback if a merger-time regrid grows the
working set beyond the 2.8x headroom, with r7a.48xlarge behind it.

**c7i.48xlarge is out.** Its hourly price sits within 3% of c7a's, which is
precisely what makes it a trap: half of its 192 vCPUs are hyperthreads, so the
real number is 0.0320 USD per physical core-hour against c7a's 0.0155. Add
8 memory channels against 12 and 3.2 GHz against 3.7, and a bandwidth-bound
spacetime evolution gets about half a machine for the same money. It is no
longer scored by the scout — the price check settles it and no further
measurement will change the ratio.

**Going smaller does not help.** c7a.24xlarge holds 192 GiB, which no full
resolution run fits into, and it costs 31% more per physical core than the
48xlarge. Trading cores for wall clock on a smaller machine costs more and
spends longer exposed to interruption.

### What the run will cost

14,600 core-hours on 192 cores is 76 hours at the reference cluster's per-core
performance. Genoa at 3.7 GHz on 12 DDR5 channels should be 1.5–2× that per
core, which brackets the run at 38–76 hours:

| | 38 h | 51 h | 76 h |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| c7a.48xlarge at 2.978 USD/h | 113 USD | 152 USD | 226 USD |
| m7a.48xlarge at 3.747 USD/h | 142 USD | 190 USD | **285 USD** |

With c7a.48xlarge now the production type the pessimistic corner is 226 USD
rather than 285. The hours themselves remain an extrapolation from the
reference run's core-hours — sec/iter at full resolution is unmeasured, and a
four iteration probe cannot supply it, because start-up analysis dominates a
sample that short. There is also a lever, and it is a physics decision rather
than an infrastructure one: the merger is at
t ≈ 713 M, so the last 1300 M of the 2000 M buys post-merger disc evolution.
Truncating at ~1500 M saves roughly 25% and still leaves the ringdown room.
Phase 5 measures the real sec/iter; that is when the call gets made.

Everything downstream of the run length in this document — checkpoint counts,
S3 residency, gp3 throughput cost — is sized against the pessimistic 76 hours.

## Stack lifetimes

```

Splitting by lifetime rather than by environment buys three things:

1. `terraform destroy` on `compute` cannot reach the simulation data or the
   container image — they are not in that state file.
2. `foundation` can sit between phases without billing.
3. Re-launching after a spot interruption is a single `terraform apply`.

    EC2->>S3: final sync
    EC2--xEC2: shutdown, terminating the instance
  end
```

The interruption path deliberately does **not** ask Cactus for a fresh
checkpoint. Phase 2 measured a 25 GB checkpoint at dx=28, which extrapolates
to about 78 GB at production resolution — minutes to write and minutes more to
upload, against a two minute warning. Attempting it would risk the flush of
the checkpoint that already exists. The recovery point is the last checkpoint
that finished uploading.

## Checkpoint synchronisation

Two properties matter more than the sync interval, and both come from the
78 GB figure.

**S3 holds two generations, not all of them.** A push-only mirror would
accumulate every checkpoint Cactus writes — 76 generations over a 76 hour run
at hourly checkpoints, 5.9 TB, roughly 31 USD until the seven day lifecycle
rule expires it. That is 10% of the project budget spent on copies nothing
will ever read. The sidecar instead alternates between `checkpoints/slot-a/`
and `checkpoints/slot-b/`.

That bounds the growth but not the size, and the two are easy to conflate. A
push mirrors the whole checkpoint directory into a slot, so S3 residency is
two slots times the generations sitting on the volume — 312 GB at the default
`checkpoint_generations_kept = 2`, not the 156 GB that one generation per slot
would give. What holds it there is the sidecar pruning the volume after every
successful push, which Cactus does not do for itself: `IO::checkpoint_keep`
prunes within a run and not across restarts, and Phase 2 ended two runs with
three generations and 77 GB still on disk. Unpruned at production size, six
generations fill the 500 GB volume and put 936 GB in the bucket, and it is the
volume filling that ends the run.

**A `CURRENT` marker, not a timestamp, decides what gets restored.** Uploading
78 GB takes minutes, so an instance reclaimed mid-upload leaves a torn set in
S3. Restore combined with `recover = autoprobe` would select exactly that set,
because it is the newest. The marker is written only after the upload returns
success, so it always names a complete generation, and restore reads the
marker.

The sidecar also refuses to upload while Cactus is still writing, and skips
entirely when the checkpoint set has not changed since the last successful
push — which is what makes a short interval affordable.

### Choosing the intervals

```
work lost on interruption ~ checkpoint interval / 2 + sync interval / 2
```

The sync interval is the cheap term: a tick with nothing new is a LIST and
nothing else. The checkpoint interval is the expensive one, because writing
78 GB at 1000 MB/s stops every rank for about 78 seconds.

| Checkpoint interval | Write overhead | Lost per 76 h run | Mean loss per interruption |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 15 min | 8.7% | 6.6 h | ~10 min |
| 30 min | 4.3% | 3.3 h | ~17 min |
| 60 min | 2.2% | 1.7 h | ~32 min |

Going from half-hourly to hourly saves about 1.6 hours of guaranteed overhead
over a 76 hour run and costs roughly 15 extra minutes per interruption. With a
spot pool scoring 9, fewer than one interruption per run is the reasonable
expectation, so hourly wins — and the longer the run turns out to be, the
wider that margin gets.

Defaults: **checkpoint hourly** (`IO::checkpoint_every_walltime_hours = 1.0`
in the parfile) with a **5 minute sync**. Revisit if Phase 4 measures
interruptions more often than once per run.

### What the transfer actually costs

Data transfer between EC2 and S3 in the same region is free, and the gateway
endpoint keeps it off the internet gateway. The bills that remain are small
and worth knowing:

| Item | Cost |
| --- | --- |
| PUT requests, one 78 GB checkpoint (192 rank files, 8 MB parts) | ~0.05 USD |
| PUT requests, 76 hourly checkpoints | ~3.8 USD |
| Storage, two slots at 156 GB each for a week | ~1.7 USD |

## What the node needs that the image does not carry

The parfile and the FUKA initial data are Einstein Toolkit gallery artefacts
and are not redistributable. The simulation repository keeps them in a
gitignored `upstream/`, and excludes that directory from the Docker build
context, so they exist locally only because the whole repository is bind
mounted — a mount source no cloud instance has.

Four files, 1.6 MB, therefore live under `inputs/` in the data bucket and are
fetched at boot. Baking them into the image would also put upstream
copyrighted data inside ECR, where a mis-set repository visibility becomes a
licensing problem rather than an inconvenience.

`make fetch-inputs` downloads them from the gallery against pinned SHA-256
sums, into a gitignored `upstream/`. Fetching rather than reaching into the
simulation repository's checkout is what lets a standalone clone of this
repository do a production run; it also starts from the pristine `.info`,
whose EOS path is still the upstream `/path/to/` placeholder the node's
boot-time rewrite is written against, rather than from a copy with some
other machine's absolute path already edited in.

`make upload-inputs` derives the cloud parfile rather than uploading the
gallery one unchanged. The gallery file targets COSMA8, whose jobs are capped
at 30 hours, so its 29 hour checkpoint interval costs nothing there and would
cost 14.5 hours of lost work per interruption here. Two settings are rewritten
and two are asserted:

```
IO::checkpoint_every_walltime_hours   29 -> 1.0    rewritten
IO::checkpoint_ID                 absent -> "yes"  rewritten (the default is "no")
IO::recover                         = "autoprobe"  asserted
IO::checkpoint_keep                 = 2            asserted
```

The two asserted settings the gallery already gets right; checking them anyway
means an upstream change surfaces at upload time rather than at 3 USD/hour.
Nothing is uploaded unless all four hold — a `sed` that silently matches
nothing is the failure this is guarding against, the same hazard the node
guards against when it aborts on a failed `eosfile` rewrite.

`checkpoint_ID` is the one that matters most. Phase 2 measured the FUKA
initial data import at 24.9 minutes locally, and it parallelises only over MPI
ranks — there is no OpenMP path. Without an initial-data checkpoint, every
spot interruption pays that cost again before evolution resumes.

The FUKA `.info` file also carries an absolute path to the EOS table, shipped
upstream as the literal placeholder `/path/to/`. The node rewrites it to the
mount point at boot and aborts if the rewrite does not take, rather than
letting the run fail later on a missing table.

### Where checkpoints land

The parfile sets `IO::checkpoint_dir = "../CHECKPOINTS"`, relative to the
run's working directory. With a run directory of
`/home/etuser/simulations/<run_name>/run`, checkpoints resolve to
`/home/etuser/simulations/<run_name>/CHECKPOINTS`, so the bind mount is placed
there and the parfile is left alone:

```
host                          container
$WORK/simulations        ->   /home/etuser/simulations
$WORK/checkpoints        ->   /home/etuser/simulations/<run_name>/CHECKPOINTS
$WORK/inputs             ->   /home/etuser/inputs  (read only)
```

The checkpoint mount nests inside the simulations mount, which keeps the two
separate on the host — that separation is what lets the sidecar rotate
checkpoints through slots while pushing output additively. The output sync
also excludes `*/CHECKPOINTS/*` so that a missing inner mount costs a warning
rather than a second 78 GB upload.

Because `checkpoint_dir` is relative, two runs sharing a parent directory
share a checkpoint directory, and `recover = "autoprobe"` would restart one
resolution from another's checkpoint. `run_name` is the parent directory, so
it should name the resolution.

## Phase 4 runs no physics

Phase 4 exists to prove the operations loop. The Phase 2 measurements say a
cheap instance cannot also do physics:

| Grid | Memory | Fits 16 GiB? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| dx=28.0 | 37.1 GB measured | no |
| dx=33.6 | 21–26 GB estimated | no |
| dx=67.2 | 11.6 GB measured | yes, but NaNs on the first evolution step |

dx=67.2 fails for a structural reason rather than a resolution one. The
`CarpetRegrid2` radii are fixed in M, so a coarser `dx` leaves the refinement
boxes the same physical size with fewer cells — level 1 holds 17 against the
production grid's 62, less than the ghost zones and prolongation buffers
consume, and the run aborts with `GRHayL: u^0 evaluated to NaN`.

The alternative would be c7a.8xlarge at 64 GiB, spending most of the Phase 4
budget on a run whose output is discarded. Instead `run_mode =
"ops-rehearsal"` writes a payload shaped like a checkpoint set — one file per
rank, rewritten periodically — which is what the sidecar actually has to cope
with. Slot rotation, the `CURRENT` marker, the interruption flush and the
restore path all get exercised, on a c7a.2xlarge, and interruptions can be
triggered as often as they are useful.

The physics waits for Phase 5 on the real machine.

## Cost containment

Two independent mechanisms, and only one of them is real time.

**Real time.** The spot request is capped at the on-demand price, so the
hourly rate has a hard ceiling. The node terminates itself when the run exits
(`instance_initiated_shutdown_behavior = "terminate"` plus a `shutdown` at the
end of the bootstrap script), so a finished or failed run stops billing
without operator action.

**After the fact.** Budgets fire at six absolute USD thresholds and Cost
Anomaly Detection watches for a step change in daily spend. Both are useful
and neither can prevent anything: AWS billing data lags 8–24 hours.

## Known operational hazards

| Hazard | Handling |
| --- | --- |
| ~~The np=192 working set may not fit 384 GiB~~ Settled 2026-08-20 | Measured at 136 GiB across the node, 35% of c7a.48xlarge's 384 GiB. The reference's 438.5 GB was a high water mark over 480 ranks on 12 nodes, not a floor for 192. |
| `IO::checkpoint_keep` does not prune across runs | Phase 2 left three generations, 77 GB, after two runs. At the measured 85.7 GB each a 500 GB volume fills after five. The S3 slot rotation bounds S3 only — the sidecar has to prune EBS itself, keeping the generation `CURRENT` names plus one. |
| Spot vCPU service quota defaults far below 192 | Raise it before Phase 5; approval takes hours to days. `make region-scout` reports the current value. |
| `InsufficientInstanceCapacity` on a 192 vCPU request | Vary `availability_zone` first — only zones listed in foundation's `availability_zones` are reachable — then `instance_type` across m7a / c7a / r7a .48xlarge. Not c7i: it is half the machine at twice the price per real core. |
| Deep Archive bills a 180 day minimum | `artifacts/` transitions after a delay, so a bad run can be deleted before it is archived. |
| The gallery parfile is unfit for spot as shipped | `make upload-inputs` derives the cloud variant and refuses to upload one missing any of the four settings a reclaimed run needs. |
| SNS subscriptions start unconfirmed, and can be deleted later by one click on any unsubscribe link | Follow "Confirm subscription" in both mails after the first apply, and note that the Terraform resource survives an unsubscribe, so nothing reports the loss. `make check-alerts` tests delivery; `make run` refuses to start billing when either topic is disarmed. |
| A budget filtered on an unactivated cost allocation tag never fires | `cost_allocation_tag` defaults to null, giving an account-wide budget. |
| Region is effectively permanent | ECR and S3 are region-bound; re-pushing means moving 4.06 GB. Decide with `make region-scout` before the first apply. |
