# Terraform targets
# =======================================================
# Three stacks with different lifetimes:
#
#   bootstrap   the state bucket. Applied once, then left alone.
#   foundation  VPC, data bucket, ECR, IAM, budgets. Months. Idle cost ~0.
#   compute     the spot instance. Created for a run, destroyed after.
#
# Ordinary flow:  make setup -> check-permissions -> bootstrap -> foundation
#                 -> check-alerts -> push-image -> fetch-inputs
#                 -> upload-inputs -> run -> ssm -> stop
#
# Everything that talks to AWS needs a session first:
#
#   eval "$(make login)"
#
# which assumes the operator role with MFA and puts the temporary credentials
# in the environment. Terraform cannot prompt for an MFA token itself. The
# offline targets -- fmt, validate, check-secrets, check -- need no session.
#
# Watching a run needs no session either. The read-only targets run against
# the observer profile, which is assumed without MFA:
#
#   make throughput AWS_PROFILE=gw230529-observer
#   make heartbeat  AWS_PROFILE=gw230529-observer
#
# A command line variable is the reliable way to pass it, because the include
# below would otherwise override the environment -- but see the unexport just
# after it, which is why this has to be a shell with no operator session in
# it.

# Load .env when present (AWS_PROFILE, AWS_REGION, scout settings).
ifneq (,$(wildcard .env))
include .env
export
endif

# A session from `make login` has to win over the profile in .env.
#
# Without this, every recipe gets AWS_PROFILE re-exported underneath the
# temporary credentials, and the SDK goes back to resolving that profile --
# which means assuming the operator role by itself, which it cannot do,
# because it cannot prompt for an MFA token. The eval would appear to succeed
# and the very next make target would fail.
#
# The consequence for AWS_PROFILE=gw230529-observer: in a shell that has
# already run `eval "$(make login)"`, the operator session in the environment
# wins and the profile is ignored. That fails *silently*, because the operator
# can do everything the observer can -- so a check meant to prove the observer
# works would pass without ever using it. Verify from a clean shell, or:
#
#   env -u AWS_SESSION_TOKEN -u AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID -u AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY \
#     make throughput AWS_PROFILE=gw230529-observer
ifdef AWS_SESSION_TOKEN
unexport AWS_PROFILE
endif
